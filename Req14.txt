Following are the differences between Project 3 and 4

1. Threadpool was designed manually in project3. In project 4 Task.run is used for the purpose. The approach was practical but it is 
easy to implement the already available facility.

2. Communication package designed in project 3 was only one package. In project 4 Every package doing
communication has its own sender receiver and IService available. It was not practical to have one comm package as all of the
softwares can be present on different computers.

3. Integrating database for Repository was not practical as txt logs serve the purpose and are simple to implement.
